# Serene

When moving into my new apartment I decided that I should at least have one piece of my own art up on a wall. It needed to be something I could stand to look at every day, and my partner required that it be abstract or geometric art. 

The original design was inspired by the Korean flag, but I didn't have an exact place in mind to hang it, so I also wanted to be able to adjust the color palette and re-size it relatively easily. In order to make the image easily scalable, I decided to use SVG.

The initial version was really just a few lines of code, but I wanted to add more functionality and coloring ability, as well as the ability to manipulate it from a mobile interface.

## Caveat

The browsers generally show SVG with the RGB color space, but once imported into something like illustrator, or if you export a PNG from an SVG in Sketch, it will display it in sRGB color space.
