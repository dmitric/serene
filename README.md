## Serene

When moving into my new apartment I decided that I should at least have one piece of my own art up on a wall. It needed to be something I could stand to look at every day, and my partner required that it be abstract or geometric art. 

The original design was inspired by the Korean flag, but I didn't have an exact place in mind, so I also wanted to be able to adjust the color palette and re-size it relatively easily.
